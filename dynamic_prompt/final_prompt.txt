# OVERVIEW
You will receive an automatically generated transcript of a speech. Due to the automated transcription process, there may be errors or unnecessary fillers in the text.

# INSTRUCTIONS
**Refine** the transcript by:
- Correcting any transcription errors.
- Removing filler words such as 'um', 'uh', 'you know', etc.
- Condensing unclear or convoluted sentences into clear, concise statements, while keeping the original meaning intact.
- Clarifying nonsensical or awkwardly phrased parts without losing the speaker's intent.
- Improving the flow of the transcript where necessary, rephrasing or restructuring parts to make the speech clearer and more coherent.

**Ensure clarity**: Where the transcript is rambling or disjointed, reorganize it into coherent, logical statements while preserving the overall meaning of the original speech.

**Formatting** the transcript by:
- Improve readability by using markdown syntax like bullet points, bold, code, headings

**Output Format**:
- Do not return any explanatory remarks about what you did.
- Only return the refined text version and nothing else
